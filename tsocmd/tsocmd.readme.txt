tsocmd Usage Information
------------------------

See the OpenEdition Command Reference for usage information on the
tso shell command.  This command has the following differences:

1.  Authorized TSO commands can be run
2.  No command line options are supported (-t and -o).  A TSO TMP is
    run for each command.  Any output is written to stdout when the
    command completes.
3.  Environment variable TSOPREFIX is not used and is not needed.
4.  Environment variable TSOPROFILE is not currently supported.  Your
    TSO profile is a default profile.
5.  tsocmd completion codes are unreliable.  This command runs the TSO
    TMP (IKJEFT01).  The completion code is the return code from the
    TMP if it is in the range 0-254 otherwise it is 255.  The TMP will
    return the return code from the command you run assuming everything
    goes well.  If not, it usually returns a 12.  There also appear to
    be cases where it returns 0 without running the command (e.g. syntax
    error).

Install Information
-------------------

The tsocmd shell command is a single load module that must be installed
in an APF authorized library.  If the name conflicts with something else
in your installation, feel free to name the command anything you want.
Note: This command is APF authorized which means anything it loads must
come from an authorized library.  This command is written in C and will
require your C runtime to reside in an authorized library.  There are
several other facilities that already require this, so your C RTL may
already be setup this way.
  
The load module is packaged in an unloaded load library.  Use the TSO
RECEIVE command with option INDA() to restore it.  The name of this 
file on this server is tsocmd.unload and must be transfered in binary 
format and restored to an MVS system as an FB 80 data set.
This data set has 18640 bytes which is 233 80 byte records.

Once on an MVS system, use     tso receive inda(tsocmd.unload)
to restore the data set.  Unless you direct it elsewhere, it will
restore in data set prefix.TSOCMD.LOADLIB.

Use ISPF 3.3 to copy member TSOCMD to an APF authorized load library
in the LINKLIST, such as SYS1.LINKLIB.

A file must be created in the HFS with the sticky bit on to run this
program as shell command.  To put this in /bin:

  from the shell run commands:
     touch /bin/tsocmd
     chmod 1555 /bin/tsocmd

The file /bin/tsocmd can remain empty.
