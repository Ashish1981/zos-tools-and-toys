Title: REXX Function Package for REXX in OpenEdition

PROPERTY OF IBM
COPYRIGHT IBM CORP. 1997,2000

This function package contains the seven REXX I/O functions and several
other useful functions.  Among the functions is an ENVIRONMENT()
function that allows you to query environment variables, retrieve
their values, change their values, and add new variables.

This package also extends OpenEdition REXX to support immediate commands
when a REXX program is interrupted with the interrupt signal, usually
control-c.  Immediate commands let you turn tracing or typing on and
off or issue the halt command.

The REXX function package is located in an unloaded PDS called
REXXFUNC.UNLOAD.  Download this in BINARY into an FB 80 data set.
