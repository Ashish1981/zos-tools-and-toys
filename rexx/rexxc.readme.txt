rexxc invokes the REXX compiler to compile a REXX exec into CEXEC
format.  The REXX compiler and run-time products are required.
 
Syntax:   
-------
 
rexxc [-cgV -o output_file] input_file
    
-V produces a listing on STDOUT
-c is compile for syntax only, no output file is created
-g adds the SLINE and TRACE options.  This is needed for execs that use
   sourceline() or any other function that needs the REXX source.
-o names the output file.  Default is .cexec appended to input_file
   The permissions are preserved for an existing output file or set
   from the permissions of the original for a new file.
 
input_file is the name of the REXX program to be compiled.  Only one
           file can be specified.
 
Install:
--------
 
   rexxc must be installed in the HFS.
   Download rexxc.txt in text mode and copy it to an HFS directory
   where programs can be run.  Permissions should be at least
   read+execute, 755 is recommended.
