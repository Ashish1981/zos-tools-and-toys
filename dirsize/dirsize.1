  dirsize -- display bytes in files in a directory tree


  Format

  dirsize {-i} {-v} { dir ... }


  Description

  dirsize does a recursive traversal of all directories specified
  (the current working directory is assumed if no directories are
  specified) and gives a report of the number of bytes in the files 
  contained in the directories and any subdirectory.


  Options

  -i	tells dirsize to ignore any symbolic links that can't be found
  -v	verbose mode: should only be used for debugging purposes


  Usage Notes

  Indentation is used to indicate subdirectories.  

  Files are only counted once, no matter how many hard links they have.
  This means that even though /bin/IBM/FSUMSSH and /bin/sh are links to 
  the same file, the size of the file is only counted once.


  Files

  There are no files used except for those specified on the command
  line and contained in subdirectories.


  Examples

    $ dirsize /bin ~
      /bin/IBM contains 11005503 bytes
    /bin contains 11005503 bytes
