rangelks
========
 
  Syntax:  rangelks
 
  This lists the processes holding byte range locks and the files
  that are locked.
 
 
  Install Information
  ===================
 
  Place rangelks in a directory where you keep executable programs
  or in a PDS where you keep REXX execs.

  If placed in a directory in the HFS:
  Make sure the permission bits are set to 0555 (or at least 0500)
  so that a superuser can execute it.  If you would like it to be
  useable by anyone, set the permissions to 04555 to make it a
  setuid program.  The file owner must be uid 0.
 
  If you obtain this program via FTP, the program is a REXX program
  in source form.  Transfer it in text mode.  As a reminder, the
  filename is rangelks.txt.
